In order to convert a .bin file to assembly .s file, run the following command:

arm-none-eabi-objdump -D -bbinary -marm <input.bin> -Mforce-thumb > <output.s>
where <input.bin> is the full path to the input binary file

and <output.s> is the full path to a file that will contain the assembly file generated by the tool
